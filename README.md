Gradle Cookbook
===============

This book aims to give you the knowhow to use Gradle in your everyday life. Gradle is a fantastic buildtool that can tackle almost any task you would like it to perform. Set out to replace Maven with inspiration from Rake, it has grown to be much more than just a tool for building Javaprojects.

Flip through the book and hopefully be inspired, like me, to start using Gradle for Java, Scala, Groovy, Javascript, Flex, Vagrant, SSH and even rspec!
